# User Login

## Introduction

The **Login** process allows registered users to access their accounts on the **Web** applications. By entering their credentials (email and password), users gain access to their personalized movie experiences, including browsing movies, watching content, and managing their profiles.

The login system is designed with security in mind, featuring token-based authentication to ensure the safety of user data.

## Key Features
- **Login with Email and Password**: Users can log in using the credentials they provided during registration.
- **Token-based Authentication**: Once logged in, the user receives a token (JWT) for secure access to the app.

## Login Flow

1. **User Input**: The user enters their registered email address and password.
2. **Backend Validation**: The backend checks the provided credentials.
   - If valid, a token is issued for the session.
   - If invalid, an error message is displayed.
3. **Token Storage**: After successful login, the userâ€™s session is maintained with a JWT, which is stored securely.
4. **Access Granted**: Once logged in, the user can navigate to the homepage and access other personalized features.
