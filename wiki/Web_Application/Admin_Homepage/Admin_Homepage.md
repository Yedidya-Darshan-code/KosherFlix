# Admin Homepage

## Introduction

The **Admin Homepage** is an exclusive page that allows administrators to manage the movie catalog and categories. Admin users have the ability to **create, update, and remove** movies and categories directly from this interface. This page is not visible to regular users and can only be accessed when the **isAdmin** field is manually set to `true` in the database.

The Admin Homepage retains the same **navbar** as the regular homepage, ensuring easy navigation back to the main site.
